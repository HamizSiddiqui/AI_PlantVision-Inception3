# 𝗔𝗜-𝗣𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 | InceptionV3 + Transfer Learning
This project implements a deep learning-based plant disease detection system using Transfer Learning with InceptionV3 in Keras/TensorFlow. It classifies diseased plant leaves into multiple categories, helping farmers and gardeners identify infections early for better crop management.

### Key Features:

✔ Transfer Learning – Uses pre-trained InceptionV3 (on ImageNet) for high accuracy with limited training data.

✔ Custom Classification Head – Fine-tuned for plant disease detection.

✔ Data Augmentation – Enhances training with flipping, zooming, and rotation to prevent overfitting.

✔ High Accuracy – Achieves ~90% validation accuracy in detecting diseases.

✔ Scalable – Can be extended to more plant species and diseases.

Applications:

🌱 Precision Agriculture – Early disease detection for better crop yield.

🌿 Smart Farming – AI-assisted diagnosis for farmers via mobile/web apps.

🔬 Research & Education – Dataset and model for academic use.

Built with Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV, this project serves as a foundation for AI-powered agricultural solutions.
