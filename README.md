# AI_PlantVision-InceptionV3-Transfer-Learning
This project implements a deep learning-based plant disease detection system using Transfer Learning with InceptionV3 in Keras/TensorFlow. It classifies diseased plant leaves into multiple categories, helping farmers and gardeners identify infections early for better crop management.

### Key Features:

âœ” Transfer Learning â€“ Uses pre-trained InceptionV3 (on ImageNet) for high accuracy with limited training data.

âœ” Custom Classification Head â€“ Fine-tuned for plant disease detection.

âœ” Data Augmentation â€“ Enhances training with flipping, zooming, and rotation to prevent overfitting.

âœ” High Accuracy â€“ Achieves ~90% validation accuracy in detecting diseases.

âœ” Scalable â€“ Can be extended to more plant species and diseases.

Applications:

ðŸŒ± Precision Agriculture â€“ Early disease detection for better crop yield.

ðŸŒ¿ Smart Farming â€“ AI-assisted diagnosis for farmers via mobile/web apps.

ðŸ”¬ Research & Education â€“ Dataset and model for academic use.

Built with Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV, this project serves as a foundation for AI-powered agricultural solutions.
