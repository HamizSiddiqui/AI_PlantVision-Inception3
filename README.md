# AI_PlantVision-InceptionV3-Transfer-Learning
This project implements a deep learning-based plant disease detection system using Transfer Learning with InceptionV3 in Keras/TensorFlow. It classifies diseased plant leaves into multiple categories, helping farmers and gardeners identify infections early for better crop management.
